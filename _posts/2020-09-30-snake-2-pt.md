In this part, we will build the grid system, which is needed for the movement of the snake.

## Position and movement

So the, first thing we have to define is the snake's position. For this, we can create two attributes in our `Game` class:

```python
import pyxel

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        pyxel.init(208, 208)
        self.x = pyxel.width/2
        self.y = pyxel.height/2
        pyxel.run(self.update, self.draw)

    def update(self):
        pass

    def draw(self):
        pass

Game()
```

we defined the attributes `x` and `y`, for the position of the snake's head. We also defined new values for the width and height. Based on some tests I did, 208 pixels is a good size, considering the sprite size is 8 pixels both in height and width (the size in the Pyxel engine). Even though we are not using sprites right now, we will at some point, so it is good to have these things in mind since early stages of development.
